    Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) always remains in the news, mostly for their star players, but they havenâ€™t won a single IPL trophy yet. However, this franchise has finished as the runners-up for thrice. RCB was one of the busy sides in the IPL 2020 auction, which was held in Kolkata on 19th December. After that auction, here we have come with the squad analysis of RCB.
    
    At the beginning of every IPL season, RCB attracts the cricket fans due to their star cast, especially captain Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers are serving the side for a long time. But in recent times, especially in the last three years, they were the underperformed side.</p>
