                This chapter teaches you how to set fonts of a content, available in an HTML element. You can set following font properties of an element − The font-family property is used to change the face of a font. The font-style property is used to make a font italic or oblique. The font-variant property is used to create a small-caps effect. The font-weight property is used to increase or decrease how bold or light a font appears. The font-size property is used to increase or decrease the size of a font. The font property is used as shorthand to specify a number of other font properties.
Set the Font Family
Following is the example, which demonstrates how to set the font family of an element. Possible value could be any font family name.choose to skip this chapter if the class has already mastered those topics. Chapters 2 through
7 cover basic C++ syntax, data types, expressions, selection structures, repetition structures,
functions, and arrays. Each of these chapters builds on the previous chapter and should be
covered in the order presented.
After Chapter 7 has been covered, you may proceed to Chapter 8 , or jump to either Chapter
9 or Chapter 12 . (If you jump to Chapter 12 at this point, you will need to postpone sections
12.7, 12.8, and 12.10 until Chapters 9 and 11 have been covered.)
After Chapter 9 has been covered, either of Chapters 10 or 11 may be covered. After Chapter
11 , you may cover Chapters 13 through 17 in sequence. Next you can proceed to either
Chapter 18 or Chapter 19 . Finally, Chapter 20 may be covered.
This text’s approach starts with a fi rm foundation in structured, procedural programming
before delving fully into object-oriented programming and advanced data structures.
Brief Overview of Each Chapter
Chapter 1 : Introduction to Computers and Programming
This chapter provides an introduction to the fi eld of computer science and covers the fundamentals
of programming, problem solving, and software design. The components of programs,
such as key words, variables, operators, and punctuation are covered. The tools of
the trade, such as pseudocode, fl ow charts, and hierarchy charts are also presented.
Chapter 2 : Introduction to C++
This chapter gets the student started in C++ by introducing data types, identifi ers, variable
declarations, constants, comments, program output, simple arithmetic operations, and
C-strings. Programming style conventions are introduced and good programming style
is modeled here, as it is throughout the text. An optional section explains the difference
between ANSI standard and pre-standard C++ programs.
Chapter 3 : Expressions and Interactivity
In this chapter the student learns to write programs that input and handle numeric, character,
and string data. The use of arithmetic operators and the creation of mathematical
expressions are covered in greater detail, with emphasis on operator precedence. Debugging
is introduced, with a section on hand tracing a program. Sections are also included on
simple output formatting, on data type conversion and type casting, and on using library
functions that work with numbers.
Chapter 4 : Making Decisions
Here the student learns about relational operators, relational expressions and how to control
the fl ow of a program with the if , if / else , and if / else if statements. The conditional
operator and the switch statement are also covered. Crucial applications of these
constructs are covered, such as menu-driven programs and the validation of inputcomputers for tasks such as writing papers, searching for articles, sending e-mail, and participating
in online classes. At work, people use computers to analyze data, make presentations,
conduct business transactions, communicate with customers and coworkers, control machines
in manufacturing facilities, and do many other things. At home, people use computers for
tasks such as paying bills, shopping online, social networking, and playing computer games.
And don’t forget that smart phones, iPods ® , car navigation systems, and many other devices
are computers as well. The uses of computers are almost limitless in our everyday lives.
Computers can do such a wide variety of things because they can be programmed. This
means that computers are not designed to do just one job, but any job that their programs
tell them to do. A program is a set of instructions that a computer follows to perform a
task. For example, Figure 1-1 shows screens using Microsoft Word and PowerPoint, two
commonly used programs.
Programs are commonly referred to as software . Software is essential to a computer because
without software, a computer can do nothing. All of the software that we use to make our
computers useful is created by individuals known as programmers or software developers.
A programmer , or software developer , is a person with the training and skills necessary
to design, create, and test computer programs. Computer programming is an exciting and
rewarding career. Today, you will find programmers working in business, medicine, government,
law enforcement, agriculture, academics, entertainment, and almost every other fieldInput is any information the computer collects from the outside world. The device that
collects the information and sends it to the computer is called an input device . Common
input devices are the keyboard, mouse, scanner, digital camera, and microphone. Disk
drives, CD/DVD drives, and USB drives can also be considered input devices because programs
and information are retrieved from them and loaded into the computer’s memory.
Output Devices
Output is any information the computer sends to the outside world. It might be a sales
report, a list of names, or a graphic image. The information is sent to an output device ,
which formats and presents it. Common output devices are monitors, printers, and speakers.
Disk drives, USB drives, and CD/DVD recorders can also be considered output devices
because the CPU sends them information to be saved.
Software
If a computer is to function, software is not optional. Everything that a computer does,
from the time you turn the power switch on until you shut the system down, is under the
control of software. There are two general categories of software: system software and
application software. Most computer programs clearly fit into one of these two categories.
Let’s take a closer look at each.
System Software
The programs that control and manage the basic operations of a computer are generally referred
to as system software . System software typically includes the following types of programs:
• Operating Systems
An operating system is the most fundamental set of programs on a computer. The
operating system controls the internal operations of the computer’s hardware, manages
all the devices connected to the computer, allows data to be saved to and retrieved
from storage devices, and allows other programs to run on the computer.
• Utility Programs
A utility program performs a specialized task that enhances the computer’s operation
or safeguards data. Examples of utility programs are virus scanners, file-compression
programs, and data-backup programs.
• Software Development Tools
The software tools that programmers use to create, modify, and test software are
referred to as software development tools . Compilers and integrated development
environments, which we discuss later in this chapter, are examples of programs that
fall into this category.
Application Software
Programs that make a computer useful for everyday tasks are known as application software
. These are the programs that people normally spend most of their time running on
their computers. Figure 1-1 , at the beginning of this chapter, shows screens from two commonly
used applications—Microsoft Word, a word processing program, and MicrosoftThe steps listed in Figure 1-11 emphasize the importance of planning. Just as there are
good ways and bad ways to paint a house, there are good ways and bad ways to create a
program. A good program always begins with planning.
With the pay-calculating program as our example, let’s look at each of the steps in more
detail.
1. Clearly define what the program is to do.
This step requires that you identify the purpose of the program, the information that is
to be input, the processing that is to take place, and the desired output. Let’s examine
each of these requirements for the example program:
Purpose To calculate the user’s gross pay.
Input Number of hours worked, hourly pay rate.
Process Multiply number of hours worked by hourly pay rate. The result is the
user’s gross pay.
Output Display a message indicating the user’s gross pay.
2. Visualize the program running on the computer.
Before you create a program on the computer, you should first create it in your mind.
Step 2 is the visualization of the program. Try to imagine what the computer screen
looks like while the program is running. If it helps, draw pictures of the screen, with
sample input and output, at various points in the program. For instance, here is the
screen produced by the pay-calculating program:
How many hours did you work? 10
How much do you get paid per hour? 15
You have earned $150
In this step, you must put yourself in the shoes of the user. What messages should the
program display? What questions should it ask? By addressing these concerns, you will
have already determined most of the program’s output.
